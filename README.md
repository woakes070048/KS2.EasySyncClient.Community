# EasySyncClient
A Dropbox-like for Alfresco ECM

This sofware extend Alfresco ECM with offline sync capabilities similar to what Dropbox / OneDrive / etc... do.

The software is made in C# and requires .NET Framework 4.5.2 to run on Windows.
It is the first working version. As such, the code is very rough and would need some reowork but due to lack of time, I can't refactor it for now

It has been fully tested on Windows and being validated for MacOs.

The software is using :
  - dotCMIS library -> https://chemistry.apache.org/dotnet/dotcmis.html
  - DynamicLogViewer -> http://tringi.trimcore.cz/Dynamic_Log_Viewer
  - SQLite -> https://www.sqlite.org/
  - Mono (for the MacOs version) -> http://www.mono-project.com/
